Ms Poh walks in with a smile every morning
"HEY KIDS" she'll sing
and yet to her dismay
the class chatters to no end
BANG BANG BANG 
sometimes its thrice
sometimes its twice
and sometimes it doesn't sound
but her morning call never fails to wake me up
ah
the sound of her hydroflask.

Ding Dong, the bell goes
Hey what do you know, its geography next
in comes the man with plaid shirt or vertical lines
with a mask that slips with each "tectonic plate"

H I S T O R Y
another round of William Farquar with the PG name
and the betrayer raffles who tricked the gullible sultans
